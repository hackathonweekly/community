		"questions": {
			"what": {
				"question": "What is a hackathon? Am I suitable to participate?",
				"answer": "A hackathon is an event where participants form teams to rapidly turn ideas into reality within a limited time (usually 1-3 days). Now there are many Vibe Coding hackathons that lower the technical barrier through AI programming tools (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot), allowing non-professional programmers to participate. Whether you're a developer, designer, product manager, or complete beginner, you can join!"
			},
			"nonTech": {
				"question": "I don't have a technical background, can I join?",
				"answer": "Absolutely! We need members with various backgrounds including designers, product managers, operations, marketing, etc. Many successful products are created by cross-disciplinary teams. The community has special guidance activities to help newcomers find partners."
			},
			"mvp": {
				"question": "What is MVP?",
				"answer": "MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, referring to a functional prototype with minimal features that demonstrates core value. In our community, MVP is more of an action philosophy—creating a useful product that solves real pain points within a week."
			},
			"activities": {
				"question": "What are the core activities of the community?",
				"answer": "We have 3 core activities: 1) Demo Show Living Room Demo Session (monthly) - showcase 30% completed works for feedback; 2) Mini Hackathons (monthly) - rapid learning and creation around themes; 3) Weekend CoWork (every weekend) - offline collaboration and brainstorming."
			},
			"collaborate": {
				"question": "Can I find collaborators in the community?",
				"answer": "This is one of the core values of our community! We encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration, and many members have found technical partners, designers, or product managers through the community."
			},
			"fee": {
				"question": "Is the community free?",
				"answer": "The community itself is free to join! Basic activity participation, work sharing, and finding partners are completely free. We are a mission-driven social enterprise, with 100% of surplus reinvested in community public construction. We also incubate independent profitable projects, contributing to community development through profit feedback, forming a healthy business ecosystem."
