We will follow the principles of legitimacy, lawfulness, and necessity to collect and use personal information that you proactively provide during the use of services or that is generated due to the use of our products and/or services for the following purposes described in this Policy. If we want to use your personal information for other purposes not stated in this Policy, or use the information collected for specific purposes for other purposes, we will inform you in a reasonable manner and solicit your consent again.

### (I) Scenarios where you need to authorize us to collect and use personal information

We will follow the principles of legitimacy, lawfulness, and necessity to collect and use your personal information for the following purposes described in this Policy.

#### 1. Help you become our user

In order to comply with the requirements of laws and regulations and to provide you with better services, strictly abiding by Chinese laws, when you register to become our user as a user in China, you need to at least provide a valid **Mainland China mobile phone number** to create an account, and complete relevant network identity verification information (such as avatar, name, and login password, etc.). Please note that providing a Mainland China mobile phone number to us is a necessary personal information piece for us to provide you with basic business functions. If you refuse to provide it, we will not be able to provide you with our basic business functions.

When you choose to authorize the use of a third-party account to register and log in, we will obtain the account information you shared from the third party (such as avatar, nickname, and other information authorized by you on the page) and bind it to your account with us for quick login. In some cases where you choose to use a third-party account to register and log in, we need to re-verify and bind your mobile phone number to confirm the authenticity and relevance of the third-party account.

In the process of your registration and use of your account, if you are willing to additionally supplement the following personal information, it will help us provide you with more personalized services (pushing specific resources, customer service consultation, etc.), such as your work unit, job title, etc. If you do not provide such information, it will not affect your use of the basic functions of our products and services.

Identity Verification: To satisfy relevant legal provisions and regulatory requirements, ensure the authenticity of user identity, and achieve risk control such as anti-fraud, when you use specific services/functions, we need to collect your relevant information for identity verification. For example: when you use the "Retrieve Account" function, we may collect your identity information, including your real name, ID card number, or other information that can prove personal identity, to verify your identity and help you retrieve your account.

#### 2. Provide customer service and after-sales service for you

When you file a complaint, appeal, or consultation with us, in order to facilitate contact with you or help you solve problems, we may need you to provide your name, mobile phone number, and/or email address and other contact information, and may use this information to contact you. We may also use the mobile phone number provided by you during registration to contact you. If what you submit is an infringement complaint, we will also require you to submit an ID card, letter of authorization, and proof of ownership in accordance with legal provisions to clarify your qualification as the subject of the complaint and judge whether your complaint is valid. If it is necessary to submit your aforementioned information to the court or other regulatory agencies or judicial departments according to legal provisions, we will provide it in accordance with the law. If you do not provide the above information, our customer service will not be able to provide you with the aforementioned services, but it does not affect your use of other services provided by us.

When you are the complained party or a relevant party in a dispute, in order to verify the content you published in our platform and clarify whether the content affects and damages our or others' rights and interests, we may also use the mobile phone number provided by you during registration to contact you.

In order to understand user demand points and improve user experience, we will invite you to participate in questionnaire surveys so that we can provide you with better service quality. We may collect personal information contained in the content you feedback in the survey questionnaire according to the actual situation.
