## 🤔 Who are we? Who is this for?

**HackathonWeekly** is an **AI product creator community**.  
We help people with ideas who don't know where to start, accompanying them from 0 to 1 in building minimum viable products (MVPs) to solve real problems.

### What is a Hackathon?
Hackathon = Hack + Marathon, an activity format for rapidly developing product prototypes in a concentrated timeframe. In our community:
- **"Weekly"**: Opportunities to participate in creation every week
- **"Hackathon"**: Efficient collaboration in short time to turn ideas into reality
- **Core Philosophy**: Practice beats theory, completion beats perfection

Whether you're a programmer, designer, product person, or just someone with creative ideas, you can find like-minded partners here.

> **Spend 1 week, create 1 minimum viable product, solve 1 life pain point - it might be the start of the next world-changing idea.**

## 🤔 What is MVP?

**MVP** = Minimum Viable Product

A simplified version of a product that demonstrates core value, solving core problems with minimal features to quickly get user feedback.

In our community, MVP is more of an **action philosophy**:
- ⏰ **1 week time** — Quick action, avoid procrastination
- 🎯 **1 problem** — Focus on core, solve pain points  
- 🚀 **1 product** — Usable and shareable, gain a sense of achievement

**Completion beats perfection, action beats planning.**
